    "## Introduction: ##\n",
    "\n",
    "Although there is not really a specific trend about US wildfires in recent years, that is, whether it is increasing or decreasing in number, this incident has been costing the US government money not just because of the losses but also the cost of mitigating fires. In fact, for the past 10 years alone, losses from wildfires added up to \\\\$5.1 billion. In California alone, the total potential exposure to wildfire damage for the high and very high risk categories amounts to a total of $105.45 billion dollars which is about 44% of the total amount for 13 states such as Washington, Texas, Oklahoma, Colorado, Montana, Nevada, to mention a few. In 2017, California also ranked as the top state to be most wildfire prone based on number of households at risk but ranked fourth in terms of percentage. Last year, California ranked second as having the highest number of fires. California, however, ranked first in terms of the number of acres burned.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wildfires are caused by different factors. According to research, 90% are caused by humans such as unattended campfires, burning of debris, downed power lines, irresponsibly discarding cigarettes, and even intentional acts of arson. The remaining 10% is caused by some environmental factors like lightning or lava. \n",
    "\n",
    "Because of the information discussed above, this study will focus on the wildfires that happened in California and build a model that will predict the size of the area burned during wildfires based on historical weather information."

    "## Research Questions and Significance of the Study: ##\n",
    "\n",
    "Using historical forest fires data in California and weather data during the start of the fire, the main question that we would like to answer for this research is to create a model which can predict the area burned during forest fires. Prior to this, we will be conducting some exploratory data analysis to analyze trends (e.g., number of fires that occurred in a specific season, year, and month and also the area burned in a specific season, year and month).\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned above, losses brought about by forest fires are costly. Thus, mitigating the impact of forest fires will be helpful to minimize not just the cost of the losses that can be incurred but also to minimize injuries or sometimes, even saving lives of people that can be involved in this type of incident. We believe that by being able to create a model to predict the area burned using the parameters involved, we will be able to optimize (that is, minimize) the days involved in stopping these forest fires. Since firemen will know that impact will be severe, the firemen will know ahead of time the number of people they need to deploy ahead of time and they can plan ahead as to the equipments/vehicles they need to stop the fire as fast as possible. By doing these, the damage brought about by forest fires will be minimized."

    "The research work and data that will be gathered in this study is based on this paper http://www3.dsi.uminho.pt/pcortez/fires.pdf and this dataset http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Forest+Fires. This dataset lists forest fires in Portugal. However, for this research, we will be collecting our own data so we can be able to apply and build a model that would estimate the size of the fire using a dataset in California.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, we will be gathering data using the following websites:\n",
    "1. National Interagency Coordination Center (NICC) [link] https://www.nifc.gov/fireInfo/fireInfo_statistics.html: This website was used to gather historical wildfire annual summary report in the US. The files are in PDF version and the table that we are going to use only lists fires that are considered \"significant\". The definition of which is that the total burned area is equal or over 40,000 acres in size. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Dark Sky API [link] (https://darksky.net/dev/account): This website was used to gather information about the weather based on the location and date that the fire happened. Before starting to gather data, a research was conducted since the original dataset (Portugal Forest Fires) used the Fire Weather Index (FWI) System in their study. This is one of the limitations of our current study. We were not able to calculate the different FWI such as Fine Fuel Moisture Code (FFMC), Duff Moisture Code (DMC), Drought Code (DC), and Initial Spread Index (ISI). However, weather data gathered used the information to calculate these indeces such as Air Temperature, Relative Humidity, Wind Speed, and Rainfall. Furthermore, research said that the weather readings should be taken at noon standard time. Therefore, this time information was used during the API call."

    "\n",
    "Upon checking the PDF file annual reports of the fires in the US, our group decided to just use the files from 2005 - 2018 because the reports prior to year 2005, i.e., 2000 - 2004, does not have the table that we have identified as containing the useful information we need for this project. The target table that we used contains the following columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "Name: The unique name used to identify the fire\n",
    "GACC: Geographic Area Coordination Center where the incident was reported and handled\n",
    "State: Name of the state where the fire occurred\n",

    "Size: (in acres) The size of the burned area\n",
    "Cause: The reason for the start of the fire\n",
    "Estimated Cost: Cost of mitigating the fire\n",
    "\n",
    "**Steps for Data Management and Collection:**\n",
    "1. Download all annual report PDF files from the above website.\n",
    "2. Save the PDF files in a folder in one of our local machines.\n",
    "3. Look for the pages where the target table can be found.\n",
    "4. Run code found below to read the PDF files and extract target table and save table as CSV files that will be merged as one CSV file and will be used for data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prerequisites for running the code:**\n",
    "Since the researchers have no experience yet in reading PDF files in Python, we had to do some research on how we can extract the PDF file in Python. After some research, we found a fairly new library called Camelot that is able to read and extract PDF files into a CSV file [link] https://camelot-py.readthedocs.io/en/master/user/quickstart.html#read-the-pdf. To do this, there are some things that is needed to be installed. These are the camelot library, cv2 library, and install Ghostscript."

    "*Size:* In terms of the size of the burned area, the mean is about 107,113 acres. Since the median at 68,500 acres is less than the mean, this shows that the distribution for the size of the burned area is skewed to the right. Since significant fires are considered to be those equal to have area burned size of 40,000 or greater, it is just expected that the minimum value is equal or slightly above this value, which, in this case is equal to 40,000 acres. The maximum value is at 907,245 acres.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Costs:* With respect to the costs incurred for the fire, the mean is about \\\\$19M. The distribution of the cost is also skewed to the right due to the fact that the median (\\\\$5M) is less than the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Days:* The length of days between start of the fire and when it was contained has a mean value of 43 days. Again, this variables distribution is also skewed to the right since median at 28 days is less than the mean. In addition, the maximum length of days that a fire was mitigated is 242 days which is about 8 months."

    "**Findings:** \n",
    "\n",
    "*Size:* In terms of the size of the burned area, the mean is about 105,508 acres which is quite close to the overall mean value of 107,113 acres. The median is also less than the mean at 78,698 therefore distribution is also skewed to the right. Since significant fires are considered to be those equal to have area burned size of 40,000 or greater, it is just expected that the minimum value is equal or slightly above this value, which, in this case is equal to 40,000 acres. In this case, it is equal to 40,200 acres. The maximum value is at 459,123 acres.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Costs:* With respect to the costs incurred for the fire, the mean is about \\\\$68M. This is a lot more than the overall mean which was at \\\\$19M. The distribution of the cost is also skewed to the right due to the fact that the median (\\\\$56M) is less than the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Days:* The length of days between start of the fire and when it was contained has a mean value of 45 days which is also higher than the overall mean at 43 days. Again, this variable's distribution is also skewed to the right since median at 35 days is less than the mean. In addition, the maximum length of days that a fire was mitigated is 164 days which is almost 6 months.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Temperature:* The mean temperature on the day that the fire occurred is at 80 degrees fahrenheit. The median is very close to the mean at 81.6. This can mean that the temperature is almost normally distributed. It is also interesting to note that the maximum temperature that a fire occurred is at 96 degrees fahrenheit.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Humidity:* The mean humidity on the day the fire occurred is about 27\\% while median is at 24\\%. The distribution is slightly skewed to the right.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Precipitation:* Looking at the observations, there was only one with value more than zero. For this reason, the researchers will not use this column for now for further analysis since it may not provide additional information.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Wind Speed:* With regards to wind speed, the mean wind speed the day the fire occurred is at 3.09mph while median is at 2.43mph. Again, this gives us information that the wind speed data is skewed to the right."

We still believe \"Temperature\" \"Windspeend\" \"Humidity\" and \"Season\" can be used to model or predict the size of the area burned however, more statistical tests and maybe some transformation of the data will be required."

    "1.Since we couldn't predict the fire trend based on our analysis, but we did get the insights about which season had the highest fires (summer), so our recommendation is to add more fire protection during summer such as hire more employees during summer season. <br>\n",
    "2.After analyzing the size of fires, we concluded spring season has highest fire size, so we recommend to allocate most easy fire area based on another history fire map analysis to separate these area by building some fire protection wall. <br>\n",
    "3.After analyzing the California fire data, we recommend to apply the same concept to other states to figure out which season has the highest fire."
