    "# Introduction and Statement of the Problem: ###\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Dataset:**\n",
    "The dataset used for this project is a 20,000 row subset of the hflights package provided within the R programming language and came from the US Bureau of Transportation Statistics. The dataset contains information and metrics for commercial domestic (USA) airline flights that departed from 2 separate airports located in Houston, TX (IAH and HOU) for the calendar year 2011. The data has 21 attributes. These includes: Year, Month, DayofMonth (date of departure), DayOfWeek (integer equivalent of the days of the week), DepTime, ArrTime, UniqueCarrier, FlightNum, TailNum, ActualElapsedTime, AirTime, ArrDelay (in minutes), DepDelay (in minutes), Origin, Dest, Distance, TaxiIn (in minutes), TaxiOut (in minutes), Cancelled, CancellationCode, Diverted.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:**\n",
    "Based on research and observation, it is evident that airports get majority of their revenue from the commercial airlines that use their \"space\" to fly passengers from one location to another. In this light, the overall objective of this data analysis is to find out which airport performs better in terms of two service quality metrics that airports use as part of their key performance indicators. Based on some data limitations, this analysis will only focus on two airports in Houston, Texas (IAH and HOU) and two performance indicators (Departure Delay and Average Taxi Time). Once researchers find out which airport performed worse on the two metrics, the next step is to find out which airline or carrier is causing the issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "The results of this data analysis will help the airport know which metric they need to improve on and in addition to this, they will be able to identify which carrier they will need to focus with or communicate more in order to improve not just that airline's performance but the airport's performance as well. The researchers believe that this will benefit most, if not all, of the stakeholders in the air travel industry, like the airports, airlines, passengers, travel agencies, to name a few.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Statement of the Problem:**\n",
    "This data analysis aims to answer the following questions:\n",
    "1. Which airport performed better/worse in terms of the average (in minutes) that aircrafts are able to leave their gates (Average gate departure delay)?\n",
    "2. Which airport performed better/worse in terms of the average (in minutes) in taxi in and out times for each aircraft?\n",
    "3. Based on the answers to questions 1 and 2 above, which among the airline/s caused the airport to perform worse than its competitor?"

    "### Problem 2: ###\n",
    "The following processes were undertaken to answer the problem above:\n",
    "1. Create a new column to the flights dataset (flights1) to calculate average taxi time. The average taxi time was calculated as Taxi In (in minutes) + Taxi Out (in minutes) divided by 2.\n",
    "2. Descriptive statistics for the average taxi time was performed grouped by airports (to be able to compare the two airports' summary statistics in terms of this column).\n",
    "3. Created a subset of the flights1 data to filter it for only those aircrafts whose average taxi time is greater than 12. The number was based on some research made by the team. Based on this link: [link] [https://www.planestats.com/aptot_2016mar], the average is 12 minutes. Therefore, an aircraft that has average of more than 12 minutes is considered not good.\n",
    "3. Performed a count of the number of aircrafts that has greater than 12 minutes average taxi time grouped by airport. Afterwhich, the percentage of aircrafts with greater than 12 minutes average taxi time was calculated per airport.\n",
    "4. Using the percentage of aircrafts with greater than 12 minutes average taxi time per aiprort, a bar chart was plotted to visually compare the performance of the two airports. Percentage was calculated since there is a significant difference of the number of flights that departed for between the two airports."

    "## Conclusion: ##\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, all of our questions are focused on customer service aspect. We analyzed \"Customer Service\" by figuring out the drivers for each attributes. For \"Delay\" dimension, airline operational issues are the main factors to increase or decrease the time of delay. For \"Taxi\" dimension, traffic system is the main factor to increase or decrease the delay. \n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, we broke down each dimension into more details. For \"Delay\" dimension, we analyzed the data to figure out which airport has the worst performance(IAH or HOU?). We found out \"HOU\" had the worst performance, so we dig more into the \"HOU\" airport to find out which specific airline caused the issue. After analyzing the bar chart mean departure delay for each airline, we concluded that \"B6\"(Jet Blue) has the worst performance, which has an average 48 minutes delay time compared to others around 20 minutes. Therefore, we recommend HOU airport to discuss the issues with Jet Blue management team to improve their opeartional management by cutting off delay time in the future.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Thirdly, For \"Taxi\" dimension, we did the same process to figure out which airport has the worst performance(IAH or HOU?). We found out \"IAH\" had the worst performance, so we dig more into the \"IAH\" airport to find out which specific airline caused the issue. Also, we did some research to get the average taxi benchmark \"12\", then analyzed the data to find out the percentage of each airline which has taxi time over 12 minutes. After analyzing the percentage of bar chart for each airlines, we concluded that \"DL\"(Delta Airlines) has the worst performance(Average Taxi Time > 12 -59%, Average Taxi Time <= 12 - 41%). Therefore, we recommend IAH airport to discuss the issues with Delta Airlines management team to improve their traffic system by idenfying any potentional problems. "
